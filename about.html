    <h3>The business model for Robinson Farms is based around the raising of  high-quality beef cattle, especially our mixed angus. We have historically operated largely through cattle barns as an intermediary seller, but we have begun expanding our sales to include online sales in 2020.  We operate primarily in a business to business model(B2B), but we are also eager to conduct business in a business to consumer(B2C) format when inquired. Butchering is not a service that we provide.</h3>
