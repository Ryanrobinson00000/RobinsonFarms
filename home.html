<h3 class="rightText">Many cattle producers in the United States subject their livestock to unethical and unnatural conditions through the use of factory farming.  Under these conditions, the health and happiness of cattle plummet.
Unlike factory farms, at Robinson Farms our cows are provided ample fields with access to ponds for water and shade trees for shelter.  They are able to interact with a safe, but natural environment, which we believe contributes to happy and healthy cattle.
